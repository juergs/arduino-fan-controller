# arduino-fan-controller

4-Wire PWM fan control using the Arduino ATmega328P (Uno, etc.) and ATtiny85.

Forked from [Marcelo Aquino's 4-Wire-FAN-Arduino](https://github.com/marceloaqno/4-Wire-FAN-Arduino) repository which serves as the basis for this project.

This is still a work in process.

## Getting started

Program descriptions:

* atmega328p-pot-and-tach - Potentiometer controlled speed and RPM calculation using ATMega328P (Uno)
* atmega328p-pot - Potentiometer controlled speed using ATMega328P (Uno)
* atmega328p-tach - Calculate fan RPM from tachometer pin using ATMega328P (Uno)
* attiny-demo - Raise/Lower fan speed in an infinite loop using ATtiny85
* attiny-pot - Potentiometer controlled speed using ATtiny85
