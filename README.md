# arduino-fan-controller

4-Wire PWM fan control using the Arduino ATmega328P (Uno, etc.) and ATtiny85.

Forked from [Marcelo Aquino's 4-Wire-FAN-Arduino](https://github.com/marceloaqno/4-Wire-FAN-Arduino) repository which serves as the basis for this project.

This is still a work in process.

## Getting started

Program descriptions:

* attiny-demo - ATTiny85 program that continuously speeds up and slows down the fan in an infinite loop
